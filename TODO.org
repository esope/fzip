* DONE bindings term fields
* bindings type fields
* change semantics of 'as'
  Currently, 'val x = ...' is treated as 'val x as _fresh = ...'.
  One wants the same convention as in ML:
  it should be treated as 'val x as x = ...'.
* add local fields 'let val x = ...' is a field that is not exported
* more examples
* support for datatypes
* recursive types (iso-recursive)
* better syntax for mixing types with terms
* some form of partial type inference (implicit arguments?)
